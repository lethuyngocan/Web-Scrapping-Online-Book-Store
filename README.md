# Web-Scrapping-Online-Book-Store
In the web scraping task, I aimed to extract data from a website using Python. Specifically, I focused on scraping information from a webpage that lists mystery books. By utilizing the requests library and BeautifulSoup package, I was able to retrieve the desired data from the webpage's HTML structure.

To construct a structured representation of the data, we stored each book's information in a dictionary. I then appended these dictionaries to a list, allowing us to accumulate the data from each book. Finally, I created a pandas DataFrame using the collected data, enabling easy manipulation and analysis of the extracted information.

By leveraging web scraping techniques, I were able to automate the process of extracting book details from the webpage, facilitating further analysis and exploration of the mystery book collection.
